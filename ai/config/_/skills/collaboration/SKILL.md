# Collaboration

## When to use
- User starts a new task or feature and needs to plan before implementing
- User asks to explore, understand, or onboard onto an unfamiliar codebase
- User asks to create a plan, todo list, or discuss requirements
- User asks about the project architecture or how to get started
- User opens a new session on a project for the first time

## Overview

Software engineering is collaborative. These rules ensure alignment before implementation.

## Learning a new codebase

First time reading a codebase / starting a new session, it is important to understand the project and the architecture to start contributing efficiently:

1. Read the project README.md file
2. Read the project CONTRIBUTING.md file

## Planning

Collaboration is essential as a software engineer.
The planning phase / todo-list must be discussed before starting development.

Agent must plan first before implementing by using ubiquitous language.
