# Collaboration

## Overview

Software engineering is collaborative. These rules ensure alignment before implementation.

## Learning a new codebase

First time reading a codebase / starting a new session, it is important to understand the project and the architecture to start contributing efficiently:

1. Read the [README.md](./README.md) file
2. Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file

## Planning

Collaboration is essential as a software engineer.
The planning phase / todo-list must be discussed before starting development.

Agent must plan first before implementing by using ubiquitous language.
