# Code Quality

## Overview

Principles to maintain high code quality across any codebase.

## Rules

1. **Avoid bad trade-offs with default values** - Fail fast, don't mask missing data
2. **Maintain consistency across similar code paths** - Same problem = same solution
3. **Extract reusable functions to modules** - Organize for reuse
