# Test Driven Development

## Overview

This project follows Test Driven Development with acceptance tests and unit tests.

## Rules

1. Preserve file encoding
2. Create a failing acceptance test if it does not exist. Add unit tests to test small cases or technical parts.
3. Implement the feature. Always double check before implementing if the function does not exist.
4. Run tests and get feedback

## Run tests and get feedback

**CRITICAL: Before modifying the code:**

Before committing, always run **ALL** tests in the solution file. If the repo contains multiple .sln files, confirm which sln to use before.

1. **Tests pass with assertions** - Verify tests have meaningful assertions that check expected behavior
2. **Code coverage verified** - Check coverage report for new/modified code
